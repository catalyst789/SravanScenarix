### **Performance Configuration**

**Where:** `next.config.mjs`
**What:** Added image optimization (WebP/AVIF), compression, security headers, build optimizations, and console removal in production
**Why:** Improved Core Web Vitals, security, overall performance, and reduced production bundle size

**Where:** `tailwind.config.js`
**What:** Optimized CSS output with future flags, custom animations, and font family configurations
**Why:** Reduced CSS bundle size, improved rendering performance, and better hover interactions

**Where:** `app/globals.css`
**What:** Added performance optimizations, reduced motion support, font feature settings, and smooth scrolling
**Why:** Better accessibility, rendering performance, and user experience for users with motion sensitivity

### **Bug Fixes**

**Where:** `app/pricing/page.tsx`
**What:** Fixed duplicate pricing plans, added proper React keys, and improved responsive design
**Why:** Eliminated React warnings, improved data integrity, and better mobile experience

**Where:** `app/components/Hero.tsx`
